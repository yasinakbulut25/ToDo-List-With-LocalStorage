# ToDo List With LocalStorage
In this project, I developed a to-do list project with JavaScript. I saved data using localStorage in my project. The user can mark the added tasks as pending/completed and filter them according to these values. You can click [here](https://yasinakbulut.com/projects/todo-list-with-localstorage/) to view and use the live version of the project.
